Client-side scripts for SSH backup
===================================

The scripts in this directory are meant to be used with the backup server's SSH
fetch script.


Installation
-------------

1/ Create an user that uses the backup-user-shell as its shell and
	/var/lib/rbackup as its home directory.
2/ Authorize the server's SSH key (limiting the key to the backup server's
	address is a good idea) to log in as that specific user
3/ Authorize the backup user to run the main script as root (see sudo.example)

If you want the archive sent to the backup server to be encrypted locally,
write the encryption key in the /etc/rbackup-encryption-key file (mode 0600 for
root). Otherwise, make sure the file does not exist.


Notes
------

1/ If the backup server is compromised, then so is the system being backed up.

2/ If you use local encryption (which would mitigate the problem described
	above), make sure you have a copy of the key somewhere.

3/ If you want to use something other than /var/lib/rbackup as the user's home
	directory, you'll have to change the backup-user-shell script.
