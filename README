This repo contains various scripts which I figure could be useful to someone.

	backup/		A set of backup scripts
	ban-ssh-morons/	A "SSH bruteforce attempts to iptables blacklist" daemon
	routers/	Scripts to control a pair of redundant Linux routers

See README.OtherScripts for scripts too small to deserve their own directory.
